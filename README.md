ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Jeff. I'm a software engineer, former [radiographer in the US Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_support_hospital), and lover of open source. I live in the Pacific North West with my partner and dog. Weather permitting, I find myself snowboarding, backpacking, and generally enjoying the vast beauty of the PNW. Weather not permitting, I find myself reading and coding.
